At the same time the cost of current and projected health care expenses continue to grow at a pace far exceeding overall inflation. Meanwhile employers are in the midst of transitioning their health insurance benefits to specifically defined, qualified-High Deductible Health Plans (Ã¢â‚¬Å“HDHPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬Â). For their part health care enrollees (participants) are often confused about what an HDHP is and what the offerings entail, as many plans feature similar economics (high deductibles, in particular) while not qualifying as HDHPs due to other plan elements. At the highest level, HDHPs feature lower annual premiums in exchange for larger deductibles, essentially adjusting an enrolleeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s position along the risk/cost continuum. However, to complement HDHPs the federal government encourages participants to open Health Savings Accounts (Ã¢â‚¬Å“HSAsÃ¢â‚¬Â) that create meaningful tax and retirement planning opportunities while saving for out-of-pocket health care expenses.
